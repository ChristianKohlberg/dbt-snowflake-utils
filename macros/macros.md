{% docs clone_schema %}

To use in the command line:
dbt run-operation clone_schema --args '{"source_schema": "source_schema_name", "destination_schema": "destination_schema_name"}'
{% enddocs %}

{% docs warehouse_size %}
This macro returns an alternative warehouse if conditions are met. It will, in order, check the following conditions for incremental models:

- The relation doesn't exist (initial run) _and_ a warehouse has been configured
- Full refresh run _and_ a warehouse has been configured

Otherwise, it returns the target warehouse configured in the profile.

#### Usage

Call the macro from the `snowflake_warehouse` model configuration:
{% raw %}
```
{{ 
    config(
      snowflake_warehouse=snowflake_utils.warehouse_size()
    )
}}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Macro Configuration

Out-of-the-box, the macro will return the `target.warehouse` for each condition, unless exceptions are configured using one or more of the following [variables](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/using-variables):

| variable | information | required |
|----------|-------------|:--------:|
|snowflake_utils:initial_run_warehouse|Alternative warehouse when the relation doesn't exist|No|
|snowflake_utils:full_refresh_run_warehouse|Alternative warehouse when doing a `--full-refresh`|No|

An example `dbt_project.yml` configuration:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...

models:
    my_project:
        vars:
            'snowflake_utils:initial_run_warehouse': "transforming_xl_wh"
            'snowflake_utils:full_refresh_run_warehouse': "transforming_xl_wh"


```

#### Console Output

When a variable is configured for a conditon _and_ that condition is matched when executing a run, a log message will confirm which condition was matched and which warehouse is being used.
